- 👋 Hi, I’m @koopercelley
I am a current student at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD), as a Computer Engineering Major. 
This account is where I will post the projects I am either currently or have worked on before.
There are some programming projects in Java and C++, as well as some folders that will have links
to other projects I have worked on (hardware, etc.).

Thanks for checking my page out!!
